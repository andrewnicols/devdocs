A special thanks to our incredible **'Integration Team**' from Moodle HQ who worked tirelessly with all developers to review, test and help finish code for inclusion in Moodle core:

- Eloy Lafuente
- Sam Hemelryk
- Dan Poltawski
- Aparup Bannerjee

Finally, thanks to all our testers both within Moodle HQ and from the whole community, who have contributed to producing our most exciting and stable release yet!

### Requirements

- Minimum browser: Firefox 4, Internet Explorer 8 (IE 10 required for drag and drop of files from outside the browser into Moodle) , Safari 5, Google Chrome 11, Opera 9
- Moodle upgrade:  Moodle 2.2 or later (if upgrading from earlier versions, you must upgrade to 2.2 as a first step)
- Minimum DB versions: Postgres 8.3, MySQL 5.1.33 ([MDL-33984](https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-33984)), MSSQL 2005 or Oracle 10.2
- Minimum PHP version: PHP 5.3.2

### Major new features

#### Files usability

- [MDL-31907](https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-31907) - A nicer-looking file picker with fewer clicks.
- Images now display as true thumbnails in the file picker and file manager.
- Other files have pretty icons for most file types.
- Files view can be easily toggled between icons view or a table view with sizes and dates, or a hierarchical list view.
- You can now drag and drop files directly from your desktop straight into file areas!
- File info (eg license information, sizes, dates) can be easily edited and viewed in a popup dialogue.
- Files can be created as "aliases/shortcuts" of other files.  This allows you to, for example, use a single file in your private files area multiple times in all your courses.  If you update the original file then all the aliases will automatically update!
- Aliases are easily identifiable in the file manager interface.

#### Repository improvements

- [MDL-32117](https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-32117) - New [EQUELLA repository](https://docs.moodle.org/23/en/EQUELLA_repository) enabling users to make aliases (shortcuts) to EQUELLA files.
- [MDL-28666](https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-28666) - If a repository supports it then it's possible to make an alias/shortcut to a file in an external repository.  If the file is updated in the repository, then this change is reflected in Moodle.  The file remains under Moodle access control however, and the original URL is not usually revealed. In the 2.3 core release, this is supported by private files, server files, file system, Box.net and EQUELLA repositories.
- The repository plugin is now able to take over the whole right-hand pane of the file picker and provide its own searching/browsing interface.
- [MDL-31675](https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-31675) - Server files repository now available for database, forum and glossary activities.

### For developers: API changes

Abbreviated descriptions of API changes are always kept up to date in the "upgrade.txt" within each plugin area.  We do this so that the information is always exactly right for the version of Moodle you are using. Changes in this release:

#### Core API changes

- [MDL-31902](https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-31902) All xxx_get_participants() functions are removed from core
- As a part of [MDL-32471](https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-32471), the signature of send_stored_file() has been [modified](http://git.moodle.org/gw?p=moodle.git;a=commitdiff;h=796495fed29f12e4a81bd406558d8eeffd0e64ac). The last two parameters $filename and $dontdie were replaced with a single array containing additional options for the file serving. The pluginfile callbacks in plugins are supposed to transfer these options from the caller to send_stored_file() - see the note below.
- [MDL-28666](https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-28666) Files API changes, added ability to create file reference using file_storage::create_file_from_reference() method, update file record attributes using stored_file class
- [MDL-28666](https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-28666) Repository API changes, added new APIs repository::get_file_reference(), repository::get_file_by_reference(), repository::get_reference_details(), repository::send_file(), the new APIs make serving files from external repository possible
- [MDL-33446](https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-33446) Make sure that areas in your plugins where you DON'T want content to change have support for file references turned OFF.  Some areas in Moodle core that do not support references are assignment submissions, workshop submissions, forum posts, and quiz essay questions - this is so that students are not able to update files from outside Moodle after any due date
- AJAX Flags: [MDL-32509](https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-32509) and [MDL-32908](https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-32908) The $CFG->enablecourseajax  and $USER->ajax fields have been removed. The fields was not widely respected and all 'advanced JavaScript' should work in a progressive enhancement and accessible way. A site wide flag still exists but may be phased out in the future.
- [MDL-27982](https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-27982) problematic non-standardised unsigned number support was removed from the database abstraction layer, all number columns in MySQL databases are automatically converted to signed, all other databases were already using signed numbers
- [MDL-31985](https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-31985) problematic text field size support was removed was removed from the database abstraction layer, all text columns in MySQL databases are automatically converted to big sizes, all other databases were already using only one text size

#### Plugin API changes

- As a part of [MDL-32471](https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-32471), the API of the plugin function xyz_pluginfile() has been extended. There is a new array parameter passed to these callbacks containing additional options for the file serving. The array should be re-passed to send_stored_file(). The change is pretty trivial - see [examples](http://git.moodle.org/gw?p=moodle.git;a=commitdiff;h=261cbbacc15ef1732a357d689908c91c15e0617a).
- Activity modules can now declare support for course drag and drop upload [Implementing Course drag and drop upload support in a module](https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Implementing_Course_drag_and_drop_upload_support_in_a_module)

#### Webservice changes

Few changes could break existing web service clients in 2.3 - untill this version we tried not to break anything. However these changes will make the client's developer life easier, so we prefered to do them now than later. Please take in consideration these improvements and retest your clients:

- [Error codes and Warnings](https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Errors_handling_in_web_services)
- All text fields have an additional format field as parameter and return value ([MDL-32581](https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-32581))
- Thanks to the increasing number of contributions, we improved our [contributor web service guide](https://docs.moodle.org/dev/How_to_contribute_a_web_service_function_to_core)
- From 2.3, all web service functions integrated in master will land (when possible) in supported minor versions (e.g. 2.3.1, 2.3.2...).
- Many [fixes](http://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-31253) and new [API functions](http://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-29934).

#### Unit tests

We have switched completely to using [PHPUnit](../development/tools/phpunit.md) for all our unit tests now.  All existing simpletests have been rewritten, and new tests have been added.

We intend to move towards a completely unit-test-driven development methodology (where the tests are written first!) for significant new code, and we also encourage all developers to implement unit tests covering at least the core features of their code.

Moodle HQ run these tests on an automated basis for all new code submitted for integration, as well as on each weekly release.

#### Community hub changes

Some bug fixes and improvements in [core](http://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-30247) and in the [plugin](http://tracker.moodle.org/browse/CONTRIB-3348). Hub administrators must update their hub to the most recent version regarding CONTRIB-3646.

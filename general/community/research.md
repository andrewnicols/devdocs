This page describes why Moodle is used for educational research and what research activities take place in the Moodle community.

## How Moodle Supports Research

There are a number of reasons Moodle is chosen as a platform for educational research.

- **Aligned with academic ethos**<br/>The open source nature of Moodle, as a software project and community, fits well with the transparency needed in academic research.
- **Extensible for research**<br/>Because Moodle can be customised, it can be used for experiments and data gathering, which would not be as easily conducted in other systems. A plugin created for research on one instance can be shared and used on another system easily.
- **Common framework**<br/> Because Moodle is freely available and more featured than other Learning Management Systems, it is often chosen as a framework for collaborative research across institutions/organisations. Research conducted on one instance of Moodle, with or without customisations, can be easily replicated on another instance.

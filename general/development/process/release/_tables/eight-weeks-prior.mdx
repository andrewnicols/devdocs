                - Move QA tests for new features in old release with automated tests from [MDLQA-1](https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDLQA-1) to [MDLQA-5249](https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDLQA-5249).
                - Remind developers to add the `qa_test_required` label to the tracker issue of new features/improvements that get integrated without automated tests. Developers need to comment on what needs to be covered by the QA test and indicate if the issue's testing instructions, or part of it, can be used to write the QA test.

                - Comment about its creation within HQ so people can apply this to the "Fix Version/s" field in the Tracker.
                - Confirm that the following filters based on the [All "must fix" issues](https://tracker.moodle.org/issues/?filter=21363) filter, and are used on the [Release urgent dashboard](https://tracker.moodle.org/secure/Dashboard.jspa?selectPageId=16582), look and work as expected:
                    - [release urgent - Peer review list](https://tracker.moodle.org/issues/?filter=18596)
                    - [release urgent (must fix) - up for grabs](https://tracker.moodle.org/issues/?filter=18594)
                    - [release urgent- current HQ work](https://tracker.moodle.org/issues/?filter=18861)
                - Rename the [Release urgent dashboard](https://tracker.moodle.org/secure/Dashboard.jspa?selectPageId=16582) to indicate the version for the upcoming release (QA part of the dashboard will not work yet)
